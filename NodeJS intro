An free and open source server environment
Javascript can be used on the server
An single language for both frontened and backened


client :frontened
server:backened

use of node js in backened 
we can use php,django,Flask ,Rails as backened languages


we learn js for frontened but we can use javascript for backened


is slightly  differenece Javascript run in server and node is
local storage api not present in node js
document object not present in nodejs


How to run 
just write node file name 
eg 
node index


//signgle thread can manage multiple connection
it is done by io model 
non blocking IO Model -> when js run on the server so single thread manage multiple connection ..kbhi bhi aik  client ki request ati hai server ke pas 
tu wo process ke time pr thread ko block nai kregi ,callback ka wait hoga(so multiple connection can handle)
Apacke can handle multiple thread
